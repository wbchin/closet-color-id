This application plans on helping fashion become an accessible and feasible topic for the color-blind and visually impaired community (including but not limited to low vision, visually impaired, and blind). The app will be an outfit generator tool that uses the iPhoneâ€™s camera to take photos of articles of clothing, uses APIs to discern the main colors of the image, stores these images with tags, and creates outfit combinations that fit the current fashion trends. Our goal is for our users to dress confidently with the help of our app.

## Running the Application

A few things to take note of:

- our application is meant to be run in light mode, design wise this matches our color palette more, although functionally it will still work in dark mode

## Testing

The only file we test in this application is the ViewModel. Using CoreData, all models are automatically generated, and thus there are no model files to test. Instead we focus on ViewModel testing, which mainly consists of coredata functionality. Furthermore, due do catch save blocks, our ViewModel test coverage is below 90%, as many catch blocks are counted as untested, when the setup of our functions don't allow for these blocks to be entered. Essentially, these blocks are here for incorrect CoreData saves (such as saving string values to an integer value field), when our functions parameters already account for type matching. The purpose of including these catch blocks was such that XCode build would succeed. Additionally, enums and color family functions are uncovered since they are purely giving names for colors based on hue integer values. 




## Use cases
### A Level
Create set-up tutorial
Tutorial to explain the app for first time users


Get the SV from HSV to refine
Utilize the saturation and vibrance levels of a given color to better extract the color family for a more accurate description of the article of clothing


Only take a square from the center of the pic to ID the colors
Collect more accurate colors because currently, the primary colors are selected based off of the most common hex, which is often the background.


Continue to work on sharing outfits
Users can share their outfits through messages (the application will generate a photo, and then users can message these photos to each other)
###B Level
Continue to work on letting users click on the suggested pairing
The second type of view page for seeing an article that pairs with an article already being viewed. 


Explain it in tutorial
Users will read in the tutorial that if the image of their article of clothing is too badly lit or blurry/out of focus
